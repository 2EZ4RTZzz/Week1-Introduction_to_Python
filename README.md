# Introduction to GitHub and Python Syntax Tutorial

Welcome to our GitHub and Python Syntax Tutorial! This repository is designed to guide you through the basics of GitHub and Python. You'll engage in hands-on activities using GitHub and work on a Python notebook to grasp Python syntax.

## Part 1: GitHub Tutorial

This section will introduce you to the essential functions of GitHub and Git. We start with a slide presentation and then move on to practical exercises.

###  Github Activities

1. Create Your Own Repository
2. Create a New Branch
3. Make a Commit
4. Create a Pull Request
5. Merge Pull Request
6. Fork a Repository

 
### Git Activities

1. Configure github credentials
2. clone remote repository
3. make a branch and commit changes
4. merge the branch to main
5. push the repository to remote
6. make changes on remote
7. pull a repository to local
  

## Part 2: Python Notebook Tutorial

In this part, you will work on a Python notebook in this repository, which contains a tutorial on Python syntax. Your assignment will involve making changes to this notebook.

### Assignment Steps

1. **Fork this Repository**
   - Fork this repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy under your control.

2. **Create a New Branch in Your Fork**
   - In your forked repository, create a new branch for your changes.

3. **Make Changes in the Python Notebook**
   - From the new branch (of your forked repo), open the Python notebook on Colab.
   - Go through the whole notebook and for each heading in the notebook you need to do the following tasks:
     - Add one new example in the tutorial.
     - Write a description of the example you added.
   - Save this updated notebook with the same name  (i.e. Introduction_to_Python.ipynb) and upload directly from Colab to your own Github account's branch that you just created. (Saving with the same name is neccessary so that i can see your changes!)
   - Commit changes to your branch.

4. **Create a Pull Request**
   - After making the changes, create a pull request in your forked repository to merge your new branch into your main branch.

5. **Merge Your Pull Request**
   - Review and then merge the pull request into the main branch of your forked repository.
